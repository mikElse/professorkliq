WP Plugin URL: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/fff-cron-manager/

This plugin will add an option to list, delete and restore cronjobs in WP Cron. It's loosely based on Simon Wheatley's http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cron-view/ 

Compatible up to version 3.5.2

It will create a backup of your crons when you install it, in order to be able to restore anything that may get broken.

Future releases may include the capability of creating new cronjobs.
 

== Installation ==


1. Upload `cron_manager.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's it! You can see your cront in a new menu in your dashboard.
